   on the canvas. But then when we export the tree to PS or LaTeX, if the font
   is too small or too large, spacing issues will ensue (since we cannot 
   determine the width of a string in PS or LaTeX directly). *)

  It is that it works left-to-right and will therefore place branches that are
  in reality free to shift (because they are enclosed between branches that must be
  very far apart) completely to the left. But we want them to be centered.
  
  The remedy is as follows. We do fitContoursL the other way around, hence called
